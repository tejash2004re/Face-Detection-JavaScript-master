# Face-Detection-JavaScript-master
### Project: Face-Detection-JavaScript-master

**Overview:**
The Face-Detection-JavaScript-master project is a web-based application designed to detect faces using HTML for the front-end and JavaScript for the back-end. The application utilizes a face detection API to analyze images and identify faces.

**Key Components:**

1. **Front-End (HTML):**
   - The front-end interface is built using HTML, which provides the structure and layout for the application. It includes forms and elements to upload images or access the camera for face detection.

2. **Back-End (JavaScript):**
   - JavaScript is used to handle the back-end logic, including interacting with the face detection API and processing the results.
   - The project includes a model folder that contains example images for face detection, which are used to train and test the face detection functionality.

3. **Face Detection API:**
   - An external face detection API is integrated into the application. This API is responsible for analyzing the images and detecting faces.
   - The API is called through JavaScript, and the results are processed and displayed on the front-end.

4. **Camera Integration:**
   - JavaScript is used to access the user's camera and capture live video feed.
   - A condition is written in JavaScript to detect faces from the camera feed in real-time, enhancing the interactivity and functionality of the application.

**Functionality:**
- Users can upload images or use their camera to detect faces.
- The face detection API processes the input and returns the results, which are then displayed on the front-end.
- Example images in the model folder are used for testing and validating the face detection capabilities.

This project demonstrates the integration of HTML and JavaScript to create a functional and interactive face detection application, leveraging external APIs and real-time camera access for enhanced user experience.
